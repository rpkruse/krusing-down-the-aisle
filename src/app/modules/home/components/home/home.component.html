      From day 1 God knew Ryan and Sarah would end up together, he just had to wait for them to figure it out too. As
      Freshmen in college, Sarah and Ryan unknowingly first met in their intro class for computer science the fall of
      2014. Fast forward 2 years to fall of 2016, Ryan confides in his friend Matthew Weis that he is ready for a
      relationship but wants some help to meet the right girl. Matthew being the good friend he is, reached out to his
      girlfriend, Leah, to see if she knew anyone looking for a relationship, or interested in a date. To Ryan’s luck,
      Leah had moved in with a bubbly, blue-eyed Texan who was a perfect match. However, when mentioned to Sarah if she
      was interested in a date with a computer science guy named Ryan, she thought Leah was referring to a completely
      different Ryan from Computer Science classes. It’s safe to say Sarah was pleasantly surprised to be meeting up
      with Ryan Kruse!
    </p>
    <p class="text-break">
      Leah and Sarah went over to a friend’s house for dinner which included Ryan. All the friends knew what was going
      on, but
      Sarah and Ryan just sat quietly not really partaking in conversion because of nerves. As the night concluded, they
      both retreated to their friends to gush about one another. A few weeks went by before Ryan finally asked Sarah out
      on an official date (which include Chick-fil-A, might I add.) I’ll never forget how perfect
      Ryan wanted this night to go. He took her to grab CFA and eat it while watching the sunset, then to go stargazing
      in Manhattan
      (a perfect night for Sarah). All of these events place between September and October, at which point all their
      friends
      were anxiously awaiting a title.
    </p>
    <p class="text-break">
      Finally, in mid-November 2016 Ryan and Sarah decide to be official with titles. The 2 of them continue their love
      affair with Ryan being the first to say “I love you” come January 2017 and growing together as a couple.

        Now for the fun part: The Engagement story. In between finishing school, getting a job, becoming an adult, both
        Ryan and Sarah grew more and more in love with one another to the point Ryan knew this was it. He would propose
        to Sarah (only after his Mom took him to the jewelry store to get her ring cleaned.) At the store, his mother
        jokingly
        said that he should look at engagement rings for Sarah. While looking he found the perfect ring and knew it
        was meant for Sarah. Bought in December of 2017 (on Sarah’s birthday), Ryan had to sit on this decision for
        almost a
        year, stirring every day about plans, making sure to not mess it up or clue Sarah in. In that time, Ryan was
        able to talk
        to Ron (Sarah's father) for her hand, to which he said yes and welcomed Ryan to the family.
      </p>
      <p class="text-break">
        When November 2018 rolled around, Sarah had her bags packed (they had been packed for weeks mind you) for the
        trip of her life to Disney World at Christmas! Ryan on the other hand was excited and terrified at the same
        time. They
        hopped on their plane to Disney for a week of fun! After running around the parks for a couple of days, the day
        finally
        arrived for Ryan to pop the question. With the tremendous help from Ashley and Jameson, Ryan was planning to
        pull of Sarah’s
        dream proposal. The only downfall would be Sarah herself.
      </p>
      <p class="text-break">
        What I mean by that is, after the nighttime light parade filled with Christmas costumes and world class Disney
        magic,
        Sarah (for better or worse) had no clue what was happening after and asked for a pretzel, then… Only after
        sending Ryan
        into more stress and anxiety to prolong with question and hope to not lose the ring, he was finally able to
        corner Sarah
        for a “picture” taken by Ashley (It was actually a video, if you haven’t seen it, please do!). During that, Ryan
        said
        everything correct he called her “Sarah Joy”, snuck the ring out...only for Sarah to say, “You’re not proposing
        now,”
        (you can actually see her saying this in the video) only to find out he was! Thank God Ashely was able to
        capture that
        magical moment between them for the rest of us to witness, and a moment to share with their future children!
      </p>
      <p class="text-break">
        You always hear stories of couples getting together through mutual friends left and right, but for Ryan and
        Sarah, their connection seemed more than a mutual one. Had certain people not coincidently had life events lead
        them to K-State, the same friend group, major and as roommates, we may not have this love story today, thus
        confirming
        my suspicion God knew what he was doing. This may be the end of their story leading them to the wedding, but we
        all
        know their story is just beginning!
